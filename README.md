# RPi-Simon
The classic Milton-Bradley electronic game Simon, written in Python to run on Raspberry Pi
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)

# Pre-requisites
Note: This is a hardware+software project!

This software was written in Python to on a RaspberryPi 3 platform. It has only been verified with Python 2.7. Your compatability may vary.

The hardware was built using the Adeept starter kit for RPi 2/3. Specifically: "Adeept New Ultimate Starter Learning Kit for Raspberry Pi 3 2 Model B/B+ Python ADXL345 GPIO Cable DC Motor" or https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FLSF4PQ/. This kit had plenty of components, including 4 buttons, 4 different color LEDs (the same colors as original Simon!), a buzzer, transistor, and a bunch of Rs and jumper wires. But you can build the circuit from almost any similar kit.
